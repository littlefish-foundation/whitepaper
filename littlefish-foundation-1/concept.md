# Concept

**Littlefish** are the actors of the system. They are individuals who want to enable and enact  change in the world. They come together on the Littlefish Platform to form colonies.

**Colonies** are digital representations of real world relationships. These can be as loose as a group of friends or well defined entities like a business or a charity.

**Colonies perform real world activities.** The group of friends may clean litter on the beach. The business may produce announce a new product. A charity may organize a new campaign, build houses for those in need, etc. These activities are then documented in whatever way colony members choose - video, image, recordings, tweets, instagram, … Collected multimedia is then published as NFTs called Actions. &#x20;

**Actions** are Proof of Activity. They contain information showing that something has been done to impact the world. Once generated, an Action can be sold by the colony to generate funding.&#x20;

Why buy an Action which represents something that has already been done? There are several reasons:

1. Buying an Action supports the colony, incentivizing them to continue performing similar actions. In this manner buying is akin to donating.
2. Actions represent values. Buying an action means you support the activity the action represents. It signals the buyers’ values.
3. Actions can be resold. They may be investments. For example an Action representing the act of writing the first draft of a Whitepaper could be worth much more if the project takes off.&#x20;
