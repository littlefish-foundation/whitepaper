Crypto launchpads are the platforms that allow projects to raise capital while giving access to early-stage token sales for their group of investors. Each investor gets tokens based on their amount of investment. In the littlefish ecosystem, each investor receives tokens based on their contribution and expertise. We call them as littlefishes. Littlefishes can be creators, artists, developers, stakers, donators, influencers, supporters, etc.
