# Rating System

### Why do we need a rating system

Rating system is widely used in the infrastructure. &#x20;

* Organizing colonies on the frontpage
* Calculation of the rewards
* For vote weights of the individuals

#### How does the Rating System Work

The rating system for Colonies is meant to guide individuals to the best Colonies shown on the front page. Ratings are coupled with messages and cannot be blank.&#x20;

Each member also has a rating and reputation which is directly proportional to the rate given to a Colony.
