# The Problem

Any idea in the process of maturation requires an expert team. However, for success, each team member should better have different expertise. In the real world, it is a scarce situation. Teams are mostly formed up of the relevant who the founder knows. This formation primarily lacks essential expertise in some fields.

The second problem is the low diversity of the funding mechanisms. For example, a mature idea might seek support from incubators and, if lucky, can get funding from the VCs or angel investors.

On the other hand, Blockchain applications such as launchpads allow funding of the ideas, leaving the projects after initial seed rounds or ICO processes.

Littlefish Foundation aims to match professionals who believe in the same idea and ease access to available funding mechanisms on the blockchain technologies such as direct donations, stake pools, and NFT sales.
