# The Problem

The past two centuries have brought us incredible advances. Through scientific discoveries we've started to understand our place in the universe. We've broken the shackles of our ignorance and built upon what we've learned. Through technology most of humanity has been lifted out of abject poverty.&#x20;

Most of us don't suffer the same problems as our ancestors from two centuries ago. We do not go to bed hungry. We do not live in absolute poverty. Whereas most of the world lived under the power of absolute monarchs for the majority of recorded history, we now have comparably more power as individuals in deciding how to live our lives.

Yet of course, all is not well. Through our insatiable appetite for progress and our greed, we have created many problems. Our progress has also come at an increasingly unequal manner. Standards of living in some parts of the world are closer to our ancestors' standards than the standards in developed countries.&#x20;

## Humanity's challenges in the 21st century

Our progress has been unquestionable. Yet with it have created many problems for ourselves, our children and the planet's countless other inhabitants. We now face a century full of challenges starting with our greatest challenge yet.

### Our greatest challenge yet&#x20;

Climate change has the potential to be the the greatest catastrophe in human history. Our blatant disregard for the state of our planet has resulted in great damage. If we don't change our path in time, we face disaster. The signs are already there.

#### State of climate change

The USGCRP Special Report sums up the results of human activities on global climate \[1]:

* Global annually averaged surface air temperature has increased by 1.0°C over the last 115 years. It is the warmest in the history of modern civilization.&#x20;
* Changes in surface, atmospheric, oceanic temperatures, melting glaciers, diminishing snow cover; shrinking sea ice; rising sea levels; ocean acidification; and increasing atmospheric water vapor.
* Rising global sea levels (\~17.5-20 cm since 1900, \~7.5 cm since 1993). This level is greater than any century in at least 2800 years.
* Global sea levels expected to rise by 0.3 to 1.2 metres in the next 15 years. A rise of \~2.5 metres possible by 2100.
* Extreme weather events are more common now: Heavy, intense rainfall events, heatwaves, large forest fires.

> Without major reductions in emissions, the increase in annual average global temperatures ... could reach 5°C .. by the end of the century.

Suffice to say, the risks to humanity and the planet at large are incredible if we don't change our path in time.&#x20;

#### Loss of biodiversity

We're living in the process of the sixth mass extinction event of the our planet - the Holocene Extinction. While previous extinction events were caused by natural phenomena - ice ages, meteor strikes, etc. - this time it's human activities that are to blame.

We have colonized the entire planet with disregard for its other inhabitants. We've made it ours and didn't think about the secondary effects of our actions. The loss of biodiversity caused by human activities is at a grand scale:

* Species population sizes have declined 68% since 1970 \[2]
* 2 in 5 plants are estimated to be threatened with extinction \[3]



Now we're faced with the consequences:

* Intensive farming and industrial developments are the leading cause of species mass extinction.
* About one in five persons in developing regions live on less than $1.25 per day.
* Wildlife population sizes have dropped by two thirds since 1970
* Nearly 40% of plants are at risk of extinction

## How institutions fail us





## How local, limited efforts are effective but don't scale
